I have loved to sew and design since I was a little girl.  I got my first
sewing machine at the age of six and at that age, my wonderful, patient mother
taught me how to make patterns for my dolls that fit perfectly.  I sewed and
designed for them much more than I ever played with them.  A whole new world
opened up for me.

As I grew up, I left the dolls behind and took on designing anything and
everything that came my way.

I have the ability to “get into” any idea and become a part of it.  With that
ability, I can take your concept and create something that you can be excited
about and know that it is the beginning of bringing your dreams to reality.
When you give me an idea to work with, I will put my heart and soul into it for
you.  It is what I do and it is who I am, and it is what I love.
