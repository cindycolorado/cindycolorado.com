# Tool Keeping
Handy ways to keep your tools organized.

**Bucket Buddies**

A Bucket Buddy is pocket pouch on a bucket to keep all your things organized.  Some uses this item has been used for:

	• Tool Pouch for mechanics
	• Seed and yard tool pockets for flower and vegetable gardening
	• Tool organizer for household appliance repair and maintenance
	• Tool keeper for landscaping supplies
	• Cleaning Supply Tote for around the house or shop, or as a business 
     
  
  
     
     
   
     
**Wrench Rolls**

These Wrench Rolls are a fantastic way to keep your wrenches safe and organized.  The design eliminates the loss of the smallest wrenches because as long as they are put away correctly they are the first to get tucked in and rolled up when the day is done.
I currently have 3 sizes of Wrench Rolls, 

    Large Standard – 3/8/” to 1 ¼” 

    Large Metric – 6mm to 23mm long wrenches, 

    Shorty – 14 slots that will hold standard or metric short wrenches(like the old Snap-on set that has been discontinued.)
