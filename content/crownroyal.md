# Crown Royal Blankets and Pillows
Made from your Crown Royal bags.

**Price** This varies as to the product and the number of bags it takes. The approximate price is $20 per bag, so if you want a pillow and it takes about 2 - 6 bags, the price will be $40 to $120 per pillow.

I recently made a King size quilt that took 62 bags.  It was $1200 and was gorgeous when it was finished. You may say "pricy",... however, a quilt will keep you warm a lot longer than the CR that was inside the bag!  LOL


Pictures coming soon!
