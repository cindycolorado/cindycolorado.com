# Crown Royal Blankets and Pillows
Made from your Crown Royal bags.

We all know people who are saving those cute little Crown Royal bags and some day they will find the right person who can make something out of them, like pillows or quilts.  Look no farther…here I am.  I can make beautiful quilts from your bags and create something for you that is exclusive.  No two are alike.  I have made all sizes of quilts and pillows, from lap blankets up to California King size quilts.  Pillows range from 12” to 24”, and any size of pillow shams.  

**Price** This varies as to the product and the number of bags it takes. Call or email to discuss choices and details.

The approximate price is $20 per bag, so if you want a pillow and it takes about 2 - 6 bags, the price will be $40 to $120 per pillow.

	I recently made a King size quilt that took 62 bags.  It was $1200 and was gorgeous when it was finished. You may say "pricy",... however, a quilt will keep you warm a lot longer than the CR that was inside the bag!  LOL


Pictures coming soon!
